# Excel-Chart-Creator
This program reads an Excel workbook (here: 'data.xlsx), creates a pivot table and a bar chart for every worksheet(here: 'Department1', 'Department2') and saves them as separate Excel files. 
The results are saved under names "Department 1" and "Department 2" in Sample folder.
